# Typhoon is a simple chat website powered by a local Ollama model


Typhoon is a simple chat website powered by a local Ollama model. It’s tuned for modern fighter aircraft and uses a small knowledge base file (`fighter_jet_kb.txt`) containing rewritten public notes.

## Quick start
1) Make sure Ollama is running and the model exists:
```bash
ollama list
ollama run typhoon
